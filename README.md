# Basic Modifications

Basic modifications such as colors can be made by changing the "index.css" file in the src directory
--clr : color
--fs  : font size

# Basic instructions for getting the code

1. Fork the repository into your own repository
2. Open VScode/Preferred IDE and pull from your repo
3. Open a terminal and run "npm install" and then "npm start" after it finishes installing.
4. Make any changes you want!

# Deploying on Azure

Make sure to go to src/package.json and change the line under scripts from
"build": "react-scripts build"
to
"build": "CI= react-scripts- build"

This is to ensure that Azure doesn't see warnings as error messages

Steps to deploy on Azure
1. Search "Static Web Apps" in Azure Portal Search Bar
2. Click Create
3. Enter any name for the app and click "Free" plan type
4. For Org, Repo, Branch, choose the repo that contains your code and it's respective branch (main/master)
5. Under Build Details, select "React" as the Build Preset. There is no API location and Output Location should remain as "build"

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
